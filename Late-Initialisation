/** In this program, I have declared a variable in kotlin without assigning it a value, which is illegal in Kotlin if we use the normal method & is only possible 
if we use the "lateint" prefix before var. It is not possible to just initialise a variable in kotlin without assigning a value, due to the feature of null safety. Also This 
feature is only possible for "var" & not "val" since it can be declared and initialsed only once. */
